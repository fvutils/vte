Welcome to VTE's documentation!
===============================

VTE (Verification Template Engine) is a lightweight tool for generating content
from templates. Its key design goal is simplicity. VTE is built on the
`Jinja2 <https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/>`_ template engine, 
that provides powerful text-generation features.
